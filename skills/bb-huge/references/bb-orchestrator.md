# bb-orchestrator — Multi-Skill Coordination & Routing Logic

This file defines how the bb-huge agent coordinates across all available skills,
routes tasks to the right specialist, and handles evidence, conflicts, and session state.

---

## Skill Roster & Routing Table

When you receive a task, route it to the correct reference file before acting:

| Task Type | Reference to Load |
|-----------|------------------|
| "scan this target", "enumerate subdomains", "fingerprint the app" | → `bb-recon.md` |
| "test for XSS / SQLi / SSRF / auth bypass / IDOR / …" | → `bb-eligible-vulnerabilities.md` |
| "what's in scope?", "is this target valid?" | → `bb-standards.md` |
| "write the report", "format for HackerOne" | → `bb-report-templates.md` |
| "what methodology should I follow?" | → `bb-operator.md` |
| "log this finding", "update status", "dump attachments" | → Stay in `SKILL.md` (MCP tools) |
| "create or look up a program", "add recon to a program" | → Stay in `SKILL.md` (MCP tools) |
| "log an observation or hypothesis", "attach evidence" | → Stay in `SKILL.md` (MCP tools) |
| "promote observation to hypothesis" / "promote hypothesis to finding" | → Stay in `SKILL.md` (Evidence Pipeline) |

**Load only the reference you need.** Do not load all files at once.

Note: Program records can include a `logo_url` field. Agents creating programs may populate a public image URL to improve UI and report appearance. See `skills/bb-huge/SKILL.md` for guidance.

## Session Initialization Protocol

When starting any new session or receiving a new target:

```
1. bb_get_stats                        — check current portal state
2. Load bb-operator.md                 — get the active methodology
3. Load bb-standards.md                — confirm what's in scope
4. bb_list_programs                    — check if target program exists in portal
5. bb_get_program_brief(program_id)    — ONE call: scope + recent findings +
                                         open observations + open hypotheses +
                                         recent recon + target context
6. bb_get_context(program_id)          — load pre-hunt Q&A; if empty, run SOP-5
7. If prior work exists → bb_get_finding + bb-dump-attachments.py
8. bb_check_existing_work()            — cross-check across findings, observations,
                                         and hypotheses before starting new work
9. Report a one-paragraph status summary before starting any testing
```

**`bb_get_program_brief` replaces separate calls to `bb_list_findings(q=…)`,
`bb_get_context()`, and manual scope checks.** It returns everything in one
compact payload.

## Evidence Handling Rules

**Rule 1 — Use the right record type for the confidence level.**
The system has three tiers: observation (low confidence / partial signal),
hypothesis (medium confidence / testable theory), finding (confirmed issue).
**Default to observation** when unsure. See the Evidence Pipeline in SKILL.md.

**Rule 2 — Capture first, enrich later.**
Create the record (observation, hypothesis, or finding) the moment a
vulnerability is suspected. Do not wait for a clean PoC.

**Rule 3 — Prefer structured evidence over file attachments.**
Use `bb_attach_http_pair()` to record HTTP request/response pairs as structured
data. Structured evidence is searchable, readable by future agents without
downloading, and follows the record when it gets promoted.

Use `bb_upload_attachment()` for binary or visual evidence (screenshots, Burp
project files, script outputs, nmap/nuclei results).

**Rule 4 — Evidence chain in `description` as it grows.**
The `description` field is a running log. Append, never overwrite.
Format:
```
## Initial Discovery — [date/session]
<what was found and how>

## Evidence — [date/session]
<what files/payloads confirmed it>

## PoC — [date/session]
<reproducible steps>
```

**Rule 5 — Promote when mature.**
- `bb_promote_observation(id)` → linked hypothesis (advances confidence)
- `bb_promote_hypothesis(id)` → linked finding (promotes to main findings list)
Evidence and notes attached to the source record carry forward automatically.

**Rule 6 — Never delete unless certain it's junk.**
Use `status: n/a` or `status: closed`/`rejected` instead of deleting.

## Conflict Resolution

**Finding already exists for this target + vulnerability type:**
1. `bb_check_existing_work({program_id, title, cwe})` — checks across findings,
   observations, and hypotheses at once
2. If match found → `bb_update_finding` on existing entry, do not create duplicate
3. If a matching observation or hypothesis exists → update or promote it instead
4. If unclear → create new with `status: debugging`, note "possible duplicate" in description

**Scope conflict (not sure if target is in scope):**
1. Load `bb-standards.md`
2. If still unclear → create finding with `status: discovered`, note "scope unclear"
3. Never skip logging — false positives can be filtered, missed findings cannot

**Severity disagreement between tools:**
- Take the higher severity until confirmed otherwise
- Document the reasoning in `description`

## Multi-Agent Coordination

When multiple agents are working simultaneously (e.g. gemini-cli + claude-code):

- Each agent sets its own `agent` field — never overwrite another agent's finding
- If two agents find the same issue → the second calls `bb_update_finding`
  and appends "also confirmed by <agent>" rather than creating a duplicate
- `bb_get_stats` at session start reveals what other agents have been doing

## Skill Discovery

To know what specialist skills are available in this installation:

```bash
python scripts/bb-orchestrator-list-skills.py
```

This lists all skill folders under `~/.gemini/skills/`. Each folder is a
specialized capability the agent can load when needed.

## Session End Checklist

Before closing any session, run through:

- [ ] `bb_get_stats` — all findings accounted for?
- [ ] Any open observations closed with a reason?
- [ ] Any open hypotheses resolved (confirmed → promoted, or rejected)?
- [ ] Any `debugging` findings have a progress note added?
- [ ] Any `confirmed` findings not yet `reported`?
- [ ] All evidence (HTTP pairs + attachments) linked?
- [ ] Next session can pick up cleanly?
