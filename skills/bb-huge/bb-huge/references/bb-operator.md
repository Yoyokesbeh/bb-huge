## Target Selection Strategy

### High-value target indicators:
- **New features** — recently launched functionality has less hardening
- **Acquisition targets** — newly acquired companies often have lower security maturity
- **Mobile apps** — historically lower test coverage than web
- **API v2/v3** — new versions often reintroduce fixed bugs
- **Subdomains of large programs** — `staging.`, `dev.`, `api.`, `admin.`
- **Programs with high average bounty** — worth deeper investment

### Program health signals:
- Response time < 7 days → active triage team → worth investing
- Low duplicate rate → not oversaturated → higher chance of unique finds
- Has public disclosed reports → learn from what others found

## Session Structure

### Phase 1 — Reconnaissance (load `bb-recon.md`)
```
Goal: Build a complete map of the attack surface before testing anything.

1. Subdomain enumeration
2. Port/service scanning (if in scope)
3. Technology fingerprinting
4. JavaScript endpoint extraction
5. Parameter discovery
6. Authentication surface mapping (login, register, forgot password, OAuth, SSO)
```
**Output**: A recon finding in bb-huge with `status: debugging`, all discovered
assets noted in description.

### Phase 2 — Vulnerability Hunting (load `bb-eligible-vulnerabilities.md`)
```
Goal: Systematically test high-value attack surfaces.

Priority order:
1. Authentication flows (highest impact if broken)
2. IDOR / authorization (easy wins, high frequency)
3. Input handling (XSS, SQLi, SSRF, SSTI)
4. Business logic (requires app understanding)
5. Information disclosure (sweep at the end)
```

### Phase 3 — Confirmation
```
Goal: Turn suspicions into reproducible findings.

1. Reproduce the issue 3 times in a row
2. Test in different browsers/accounts if relevant
3. Assess real-world impact (what can an attacker actually do?)
4. Build minimal PoC (strip out noise)
5. Update bb-huge: status → confirmed
```

### Phase 4 — Documentation (load `bb-report-templates.md`)
```
Goal: Write a report that gets triaged correctly the first time.

1. Fill all fields in bb-huge
2. Attach all evidence
3. Generate report from template
4. Self-review: is the impact clear? are steps reproducible?
```

## High-Frequency Finding Patterns

These are the most commonly found bugs in modern web apps — test these first:

### Pattern 1 — IDOR on numeric IDs
```
Profile: GET /api/user/1234
Test:    GET /api/user/1235 with your own auth token
Signal:  Returns another user's data
```

### Pattern 2 — Mass assignment via extra JSON fields
```
Profile: PUT /api/user {"name": "test"}
Test:    PUT /api/user {"name": "test", "role": "admin", "is_verified": true}
Signal:  Any of the extra fields reflected in response or change behavior
```

### Pattern 3 — JWT algorithm confusion
```
Profile: Decode JWT header → look for "alg": "RS256"
Test:    Re-sign with HS256 using the public key as the secret
Tool:    jwt_tool, portswigger JWT editor
```

### Pattern 4 — OAuth redirect_uri manipulation
```
Profile: Find OAuth flow, locate redirect_uri parameter
Test:    redirect_uri=https://attacker.com or use open redirect on same domain
Signal:  Auth code or token returned to attacker-controlled URL
```

### Pattern 5 — SSRF via URL parameters
```
Profile: Any parameter that takes a URL (webhooks, avatars, import, preview)
Test:    Burp Collaborator / interactsh URL as value
Signal:  DNS or HTTP callback received
```

### Pattern 6 — Stored XSS in user-controlled fields
```
Profile: Any field that renders back to other users (name, bio, comments, titles)
Test:    <img src=x onerror=alert(1)> or SVG payloads
Signal:  Executes in another session (use two accounts)
```

## Time Management

**Single-day session:**
- 60% recon + attack surface mapping
- 30% testing top 3 vulnerability patterns
- 10% documentation

**Multi-day engagement:**
- Day 1: Full recon, map everything, create recon finding in bb-huge
- Day 2–3: Deep testing on identified high-value surfaces
- Day 4: Confirmation + PoC building
- Day 5: Report writing

**When to move on:**
- No finding after 2 hours on a specific surface → move to next surface
- Stuck on a finding for 1 hour → note current state in bb-huge, come back later
- Found one critical → document it fully before continuing

---

## Context Preservation Between Sessions

The bb-huge portal is your persistent memory. Use it aggressively:

- Every hypothesis → create a finding with `status: debugging`
- Every dead end → update the finding with a note, set `status: n/a`
- Every partial finding → update description with "Progress as of [date]: ..."
- Session start → always run `bb_get_stats` + `bb_list_findings` first

This ensures a new session (or a new agent) can pick up exactly where you left off.

## Red Flags That Signal a Juicy Target

These patterns in an application suggest higher attack surface:

- Custom authentication system (not using standard libs)
- File upload functionality
- PDF/image generation or processing
- Import/export features (CSV, XML, JSON)
- URL preview / fetch-by-URL functionality
- User-generated HTML or Markdown that gets rendered
- Admin panel accessible from the internet
- GraphQL API (introspection often enabled)
- Swagger/OpenAPI docs publicly accessible
- `X-Forwarded-For` accepted and used for logic
- `debug=true` or `test=1` accepted parameters
